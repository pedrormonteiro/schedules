## Personal Notes

As a way to demonstrate the stack I am most comfortable with, I decided to develop this assessment using the following technologies:
- Next.js
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- Zustand

Personally, I feel that this was a great experience, both to show my personal development/skills and to better understand Blue Prism's requirements.

Also, I used the original backend, there is no need to change the code :)

#### Next Steps
- Unit tests
- Refactor grid structure if needed




## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
